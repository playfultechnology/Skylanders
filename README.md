# SkylandersLightcore
Reverse-engineering and remixing the technology behind "Skylanders" figures

The circuit contains a speed full bridge rectifier made with 2 dual diodes (BAT54S), some smoothing caps, and a current limiting resistor. 
This pcb is actually designed for 2 LEDs (as used in some Lightcore figurines), hence the 2 resistors and +/- outputs.
